# The C Programming Language
This repository contains my solutions to a collection of problems from the classic book The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (2nd Edition). This book is one of the foundational texts in computer science, and I've worked through these exercises to deepen my understanding of C programming.
